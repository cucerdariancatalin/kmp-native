# KMP Algorithm in Kotlin

KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) is a linear-time pattern matching algorithm that finds the occurrence of a substring within a given string. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to understand the implementation of the KMP Algorithm in Kotlin language. This project contains the code for the KMP algorithm, which can be used to perform pattern matching operations on strings.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should have a basic understanding of string operations, algorithms and Kotlin programming language.

## Installing

To use this repository, simply clone the repository and run the code on your local machine.

## Running the tests

To test the code, you can write test cases in the main function and run the code. You will see the output of the code, which will show you whether the KMP algorithm is working as expected.

## Built With

- Kotlin
